Previous Font: Hoefler Text

## New Fonts

I chose the following new fonts to add to the website:

* Spectral
* Karla

I chose Spectral and Karla as the two fonts to implement. Spectral is a serif-font, and I will implement it as a header font (h1, h2, h3), as it is clean, some-what "fancy/upscale" and easy to read. The previous font was an "Old Style" Hoefler Text, classic and traditional. The new font, Spectral, is a bit more transitional and Modern.  I chose spectral because there is a larger spacing in-between letters which improves legibility. I chose Karla, a sans-serif typeface, for the paragraph text because it is modern and constrasts nicely with Spectral. I believe that the two fonts add a sense of moderness plus a sense of class.

## CSS Changes

Overall, there weren't too many changes that I made to the site. CSS wise, I first changed the fonts to their new typefaces. I noticed that the paragraph font was a little hard to read, so I upped the size and increased the line spacing to increase legibility. 

The only other CSS change that I made was to change the background color of the container to white. This increases the constrast between the typeface and the background -- increasing reability.  

### List of All Changes

- Changed the header font to Spectral 
- Changed paragraph font to Karla
  - changed line height so there is a little more white space
- Changed backgrounds to white to increase readability
- HTML/CSS clean up, so many spaces oh my
- changed index page name to "index.php" so its recognized by the server
